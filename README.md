Why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements, mentioned above.

- My project uses both Django and Javascript and the core concepts teached on this course. From the creation of different models,
to routing and conditional rendering, to database interaction and Javascript for the web to make user interactivity more attractive. 

Whatâ€™s contained in each file you created.

- On the templates folder we can find the different templates used on this app.
On the admin.py file we can find the models that have been registered for the app.
On models.py, the definition of the models used on the app.
ON urls.py the definition of the routes.
And finally on views.py, the logic for rendering the different views.

How to run your application.

- My app can be run by running the "python manage.py runserver" command.
